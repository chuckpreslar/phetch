======

__phetch__ is a light wrapper around [isomorphic fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) ([fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/GlobalFetch/fetch)) that allows request generation via the chaining of methods calls instead of bloating methods with crafting initialization or configuration objects.
